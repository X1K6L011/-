<h3>Summary: Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Aza Holmes&rsquo;s story begins in her high school cafeteria with her friends Daisy and Mychal. Here, she considers that she is not the author of her own life but rather the product of outside forces controlling her. Aza hears the sounds of her digestion and becomes anxious about the bacteria in her gut. Daisy tries to engage Aza by asking her about a boy Aza went to camp with, Davis Pickett, but she is focused on her fear of the bacteria&nbsp; <em> C. diff&nbsp; </em> and the possibility of it causing a deadly infection in her. She shifts her focus to the callus on her finger and feels compelled to make it bleed to make sure it is not infected. Aza tells Daisy that she knows of Davis but is still distracted by her thoughts. As they leave the cafeteria, Aza reflects that she does remember Davis and that he was someone who saw the world the way she does.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Aza&rsquo;s mom, a math teacher at the school, stops Aza on her way to class and asks her if she feels anxious and if she is taking her medication. Aza deflects instead of answering directly. She tells her mom that she is taking her medicine even though she only takes it three times a week instead of daily. Aza continues with her school day before walking to her car to meet Daisy and drive her to work. Daisy mentions Davis again, telling Aza that there is a $100,000 reward for information regarding Russell Pickett, Davis&rsquo;s father, since he disappeared before police executed a search warrant on his home related to a fraud and bribery investigation. Daisy says that they have a chance to find information and get the reward since Aza knows Davis. Aza thinks about finding information and remembers that the Picketts have an unmonitored camera at the back of their property, so the two girls decide to check out the camera instead of Aza taking Daisy to work.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 3</h3>
<p>Since Aza lives on the same river as the Picketts, Aza and Daisy take a canoe to the Pickett&rsquo;s property to find the camera. Aza reflects on her childhood while they paddle down the river. She thinks about how her dad used to take pictures of the sky through tree branches and about the birthday party she had where her mom buried treasure on an island in the river. She remembers that Davis went to the party and he freaked out that he lost his Iron Man action figure before Aza&rsquo;s mom found it. Aza and Daisy climb a floodwall to get to the Pickett&rsquo;s property and they find the camera. Aza accesses the photos, including one of Russell walking in the woods the night he disappeared. Lyle, the Pickett&rsquo;s security guard, catches them after Aza downloads the photos. Daisy breaks a hole in the canoe, so it looks like they are stranded. She tells Lyle that Aza knows Davis, so he offers to help them get home.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Lyle drives Aza and Daisy to the Pickett house and threatens to have them booked for trespassing if Davis does not know them. They see Davis by the pool and he immediately greets Aza by name. He asks Lyle to bring them Dr Pepper because he remembers that it is Aza&rsquo;s favorite drink. Aza asks Davis to tell her what he is thinking. He says that he has been thinking about her, but he is sad to see her now because it means she is after the reward money just like everyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Daisy tells Davis that they lied about crashing the canoe and says they purposely wrecked it because Aza has a crush on him and wanted to see him. They talk for a while before Malik, the zoologist who studies tuatara (lizard-like reptiles known for their long lifespan), shows them Russell&rsquo;s pet tuatara, Tua. Daisy tells them she needs to get home and Aza follows Davis into the house while he gets his keys. In Davis&rsquo;s room, she picks up his Iron Man figurine and Davis tells her to be careful as that is the only possession he loves. He drives the girls home. Daisy presses him for information about his dad, but he emphatically expresses that he does not know where his father is and does not want him to come back. Before Davis and Aza part, he comments on the wound on Aza&rsquo;s finger and she replies that pain in life is irrelevant.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 5</h3>
<p>Aza drives Daisy home and Daisy claims that she can tell Aza likes Davis. Aza denies it and says she is not looking for a romantic relationship. Daisy changes the subject and informs Aza that Malik told her Tua will receive the entire Pickett fortune when Russell dies. The fact that Russell is not leaving any money to his sons convinces Daisy that Davis would turn in his father if he knew his location. Daisy leaves Aza to go babysit her sister. Aza returns home and begins watching TV with her mom but struggles with intrusive thoughts about the cleanliness of the wound on her middle finger. Concerned about infection from the river water, Aza excuses herself to go to the bathroom to open the wound, clean it, and rebandage it. She leaves the bathroom, with intrusive thoughts about her finger continuing to distract her.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 6</h3>
<p>After school the next day, Aza drives around Indianapolis to fill the time before she plans to meet Daisy to discuss Russell Pickett. She goes home and her mom informs her that Lyle dropped off the canoe, which has been repaired. Her mom questions why Aza and Daisy would go canoeing unless their intent was to see Davis Pickett. Aza explains that they wanted to see Davis because they were concerned about him since his dad was in the news so much. She wonders why a lot of people do not seem to like their dads very much. Her mom comments that Aza&rsquo;s dad understood Aza&rsquo;s fear. Her mom says that she cannot believe Aza&rsquo;s dad left them&mdash;as if he had chosen to die.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Aza leaves and meets Daisy at Applebee&rsquo;s, their favorite study spot. They talk about Daisy&rsquo;s Star Wars fanfiction before researching the Picketts. Aza finds that Davis has not been active online since Russell disappeared. Aza also discovers multiple lawsuits filed against Russell&rsquo;s company and that Pickett Engineering failed to complete a sewage project, Pogue&rsquo;s run, despite evidence of bribing state officials to win the contract. Meanwhile, Daisy pretends to be a journalist and receives a copy of the police report regarding Russell&rsquo;s disappearance. Daisy suggests that Aza should text Davis.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 7</h3>
<p>Aza drives her mom to school and her mother comments on her anxious behavior. She implies that she is regularly taking her medication instead of sharing her thoughts that taking a pill to be herself is wrong. Mychal approaches Aza in the hallway and she thinks he wants to ask her out. After Aza rejects him, he clarifies that he actually wants her opinion on asking Daisy out. Aza tells him to ask her and goes to class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In class, Daisy texts Aza about Mychal and the police report. Aza questions whether it is fair to Davis for them to tell the tip line about the photo of Russell leaving the property, but Daisy assures her they would be holding a crook accountable for his actions. Davis texts Aza while in class and vents to her about people liking him because of what he has and not who he is. Aza asks him if it would make things better or worse if she called the tip line. Davis says it would be worse because he worries about how his brother, Noah, would react. Aza assures him that she will not contact the tip line about what she knows.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 8</h3>
<p>The next day, Daisy waits for Aza at school to tell her that she and Mychal would go on a double date with Aza and Davis. Aza texts Davis about meeting them at Applebee&rsquo;s on Friday, which he agrees to. After school, Aza goes to Dr. Singh&rsquo;s office for her appointment. She thinks about how she wants to tell Dr. Singh that she is getting better because that is what should happen with an illness. They discuss how Aza does not feel in control of her thoughts and that maybe she is not her own self. Dr. Singh acknowledges the metaphors that Aza uses to talk about pain and observes that pain can only really be talked about with metaphors. Aza gets distracted by thoughts of&nbsp; <em> C. diff&nbsp; </em> during their time together despite Dr. Singh assurance that she is not dying from it. Dr. Singh reminds her she needs to take her medication every day.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 9</h3>
<p>Aza prepares for the double date with Davis, Daisy, and Mychal, and her mom warns her to be careful around Davis because wealth makes people careless. Aza responds that Davis is not his wealth. They meet at Applebee&rsquo;s and Davis treats the group to dinner. Afterwards, he invites them to his house to watch a movie. At the house, Aza and Davis go outside while Daisy and Mychal look at the art inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis teaches Aza about the stars, planets, and light pollution, and they hold hands. She opens up about feeling like a fish with the parasite&nbsp; <em> Diplostomum pseudopathaceum </em> . The parasite causes fish to commit suicide on the surface of the water so the parasite can reproduce, and, like the fish, she does not feel in control of her life. She also tells him that her fixation on her finger began as a way to feel pain to tell whether she was real or not. Davis responds by sharing about visiting his mom in the hospital as she died. He feels their connection is too good to be true because he thinks Aza probably wants the reward money. He gives her $100,000 as a reward for not sharing what she knows. Back at the house, Aza finds Noah and tries to comfort him. Noah sends Aza notes from his father&rsquo;s phone, specifically asking her if she knows what the note &ldquo;jogger&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo; means. He asks her to keep looking for information.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 10</h3>
<p>Aza makes plans with Daisy to meet at Applebee&rsquo;s to tell her about the money. Aza researches the notes from Russell&rsquo;s phone before meeting Daisy but does not find out anything new. Aza arrives at Applebee&rsquo;s early and looks through her own father&rsquo;s phone, which she keeps in the trunk of her car. She enjoys looking at the pictures he took because she can see the world the way he saw it. When Daisy arrives, Aza tells her to get in the car and shows her the money. Aza is uncertain about keeping the money, but Daisy convinces her that it is okay.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 11</h3>
<p>Simon Morris, the Pickett&rsquo;s lawyer, calls Aza to arrange for Daisy and Aza to deposit their money in an inconspicuous manner. Aza asks Simon if anyone is looking after Davis and Noah and he tells her that they are provided for from a legal standpoint. Aza and Daisy drive to the bank where Simon arranged for them to deposit the money. While driving, Aza is consumed by thoughts about her finger and pulls over to apply hand sanitizer and a new Band-Aid. She does this multiple times before she can bring herself to drive again. Daisy is sympathetic and tells Aza that she wishes she understood what she is going through. After depositing the money, Aza drops off Daisy and returns home, where she takes a pill because she is still panicked about her finger. She texts Davis, proving she actually likes him. They make plans to watch a meteor shower together on the following Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aza arrives at school on Thursday to find that Daisy bought a car and a book on colleges. Aza looks through the college book and dreams about going away to college. Davis texts Aza that they will not be able to see the meteor shower because of the weather but Aza assures him that she is more interested in seeing him than a meteor shower. Daisy works on homework at Aza&rsquo;s house and Aza advises her to not spend all the money at once. Daisy gets angry because she feels like Aza is judging her and they fight, but they both apologize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis drives over to pick up Aza and her mom insists that he come inside to meet her. Aza&rsquo;s mom makes Davis cry by insinuating that he always gets what he wants. Aza comforts him and they go to his house. Outside, Davis describes what the meteor shower would look like if they could see it. They talk about Davis&rsquo;s poetry and Aza kisses him.

When Aza returns home, she tries to calm her anxiety. Her mom can tell she is anxious and sings her to sleep.</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 13</h3>
<p>Davis texts Aza the next morning to assure her that he likes her body since he thinks her anxiety from the night before is because she either hates or fears her body. Aza has an appointment with Dr. Singh and they discuss that Aza thinks she is fiction. Aza wants to know if anything will make her happy if having a boyfriend does not make her happy. Dr. Singh tells her that any change, even good change like a boyfriend, is stressful and she should give herself grace and understanding. She also assures Aza that she is real and that her own doubts about reality help to prove that. At home, Aza&rsquo;s mom apologizes again about making Davis cry. Aza tells her she&rsquo;s thinking about going away to college. Aza excuses herself and texts Davis.

They decide to facetime each other in the dark. After they hang up, Davis texts Aza that he likes the two of them together.</p>

<h3>Summary: Chapter 17</h3>
<p>Aza drives to the Pickett&rsquo;s house to spend time with Davis and she tells him that she read the unflattering characterization of herself in Daisy&rsquo;s fanfiction.

They jump in the pool even though it is freezing outside. They swim and Davis expresses his disdain for Tua. They make plans to meet the following week at Aza&rsquo;s house and Aza tells her mom about it when she gets home. She reads more of Daisy&rsquo;s stories that night as well as information about the microbiome affecting the brain.

She goes to bed feeling sick.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 18</h3>
<p>Aza is tired the next day from sleepless nights and drinking too much hand sanitizer, but she had already made plans to take Daisy to Applebee&rsquo;s. In the car, Aza confronts Daisy about writing about her in her fanfiction stories. Daisy apologizes for writing something negative but explains that it is her way of coping since Aza is a lot to deal with. She tells Aza that she is too selfish to get out of her own head, read Daisy&rsquo;s stories, or know anything about Daisy&rsquo;s life. Aza yells back at Daisy and accidentally hits the car in front of her. Aza, injured, gets out of the car and tries to pull her dad&rsquo;s phone out of the trunk but falls over in pain. People around her try to calm her down thinking that she is upset because she believes her parents will be mad at her. She eventually collapses in pain. Aza wakes up in the hospital with her mom there and thinks her ribs are broken. She asks if she will be put on antibiotics.</p>

Aza is concerned about the increased risk of&nbsp; <em> C. diff&nbsp; </em> from staying in the hospital. Her mom stays there with her. Aza wakes up in the night consumed with thoughts of bacteria, in her finger, in her body, or in the air of the hospital. Aza texts Daisy to apologize again. Daisy responds back with an apology and concern for her friend. Still consumed with thoughts about&nbsp; <em> C. diff </em> , Aza gets out of bed and begins drinking the hand sanitizer from the dispenser on the wall.

<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 20</h3>
<p>After drinking the hand sanitizer from the dispenser in the hospital, Aza wakes up in a fog. She reflects on the pain she feels and notices the things around her like the bowl of Cheerios her mom made her and the flowers Davis sent. She still has nagging thoughts about bacteria that scare her, so she tells her mom she is in trouble.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 21</h3>
<p>Aza tells the reader how she thinks her story should go. She thinks her thoughts should be consumed with figuring out Russell&rsquo;s disappearance, she should gain control over her intrusive thoughts, and she should walk into the sunset like in a movie with either Daisy or Davis. In reality, she is bored with the slowness of her recovery. Dr. Singh puts her on a new medication and gives her hope that this medicine will help her. After she is released from the hospital, Aza stays at home for two weeks with Daisy and Davis visiting her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Aza returns to school, she has a picnic with Daisy. Aza tries to explain to Daisy how she sees the world. She feels like other things control her, whether it&rsquo;s her medicine, the bacteria in her gut controlling her brain, or the bacteria she&rsquo;s exposed to every day. Daisy responds by telling her a story about a man explaining to a scientist that the world does not exist by itself, but rather the world sits on top of a turtle that is on top of another turtle on top of another with turtles all the way down. Aza likes the metaphor. On the way to class, Aza stops by her mom&rsquo;s classroom and tells her about the $50,000 from Davis. Her mom urges her to return it but Aza tells her she does not feel indebted to Davis. Aza texts Davis and they plan to meet at Applebee&rsquo;s the next night.</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 22</h3>
<p>Aza meets Davis for dinner at Applebee&rsquo;s. She fears kissing him because of possible bacteria. She struggles with intrusive thoughts with him sitting close to her and asks him to move to the other side of the table. She tells him that being together is not going to work because she is not going to get better one day and that she cannot just get over her terror of the bacteria associated with being close to another person. He acknowledges that that is scary and Aza changes the topic to Noah. They catch up on each other&rsquo;s lives and the conversation ends. Aza texts him when she gets home that night. He responds that he cannot just be with her over the phone just like she cannot be with him in person. Neither one says anything after that.</p>
<p>The next day at school, Daisy invites Aza to join her and Mychal at an art show where Mychal has art displayed. Aza joins them at the Pogue&rsquo;s Run tunnel, the tunnel that the Pickett&rsquo;s company was supposed to expand. When they arrive, other artist begin talking to Mychal, so Aza and Daisy walk around. After viewing the art, Aza and Daisy go for a walk through the tunnels. When they reach the end of the tunnel, Aza makes the connection that they are at the mouth of the river, meaning that &ldquo;jogger&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo; is a play on words for the mouth of Pogue&rsquo;s run. The smell of decay rather than sewage makes Daisy and Aza think that Russell had been down here and died.</p>
<div class="pw-incontent">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 23</h3>
<p>Aza procrastinates on telling Davis about the connection between jogger&rsquo;s mouth and Pogue&rsquo;s run. She eventually asks him to come over so she can tell him privately that she thinks she knows what happened to Russell. When Aza explains her revelation, Davis asks if she thinks Russell has been hiding in the tunnel, but Aza insinuates that the smell suggests that he died. Davis is obviously distressed and Aza tries to comfort him as he questions what he should do next. Davis leaves and Daisy comes over. Daisy comforts Aza with the thought that, even though life has been hard, they at least got some money out of it. She tells Aza that even though they do not get to pick everything that happens in their story, they get to pick the frame with which they look at it.</p>
<h3>Summary: Chapter 24</h3>
<p>A month later, Aza sees on the news that Russell&rsquo;s body was found. Aza texts Davis to let him know that she and Daisy did not tip off the police. Davis responds that he knows it wasn&rsquo;t them. Davis and Noah had called in the tip anonymously so they could find out for sure the fate of their father. Aza feels that she should have waited to tell Davis about his father so he and his brother would have been able to continue living off of the family fortune before everything was left to tuatara research, but her mom reminds her to be kind to herself. Aza texts Davis to ask him to hang out some time, but her never responds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Months later, Davis appears at Aza&rsquo;s house to deliver a gift. He tells her that he is moving to Colorado with Noah. Aza opens the gift after Davis leaves and finds a painting of spirals. Aza&rsquo;s perspective shifts to her future self, talking about how her current self does not know that life goes on. She speaks of going to college, finding a job, and seeing the ups and downs of her life. She says that she, a singular person that&nbsp; <em> does&nbsp; </em> exist, will go on even if she does not know it yet.</p>
